Steps of how blackjack is played:
1. Players make their bets
2. Players are dealt with 2 cards
3. Dealt is dealt 2 cards where the second card is hidden from the players.

OBJECTIVES OF THE GAME
----------------------

Have a higher total point than the dealer
Anything over 21 is an automatic loss (bust)
Aces can be worth 1 or 11; every other card is worth its face amount (worth 10 points)
An ace and a face card is called a blackjack
After each round options to the players are:
-> Option to hit (receive more cards)
-> Option to stay (no more cards)

Hitting > 21: Automatic bust
Hitting == 21: Automatic win

After players hit/stay: 
-> Dealer flips over his/her hidden card
-> While dealer's total is greater than >= 17, dealer keeps hitting the cards

If dealer busts -> any player who did not bust earlier wins his or her bet. 
If the dealer does not bust -> Dealer's total is compared to each player's total.

For any player who's total is greater than the dealer's total -> Player wins the amount that was placed
For any player whose total is less than the dealer's he or she loses the money
In the event of a tie -> No money is exchanged

CODE PROCESS
------------

1. Import Libraries
2. Creating a function that creates a new deck of cards
3. Function that lists out all permutations of ace values
4. Calculating the value of cards in our hand (including correct handling of aces)
5. MAIN LOOP
    -> For loop for iterating over 50000 stacks
    -> While loop: for each stack of cards, plays blackjack until there are 20 or fewer cards in the stack. 
       At that point it moves onto the next stack
    -> Game results: 1 for win, 0 for a tie, -1 for a loss
